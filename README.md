Program explanation:

The idea of this program is to use machine learning to predict the final grade of the portuguese course of some students from Lisboa.

This is the first release of the program in which you can load the students data from a .csv file, with the loaded data you can filter the table in any field and display charts based on the loaded data.

How the program works:

This is the first window you see when the program is executed, you can open a file dialog by clicking the button:

In this file manager you can select the .csv file and load the students data:

Once you have loaded the students data from the .csv file, a new window with three tabs is displayed, the Table tab allows you to see the table of students.

In the inferior left corner you have the filter, where you can choose any field and filter the table.
